### Hi there, I'm Gustavo Schlieper Tessitore!

As a Tech Lead at Looqbox and a data science and artificial intelligence student at PUC-SP, I am deeply passionate about harnessing the power of data to drive insightful business decisions and create impactful technological solutions.

At Looqbox, I lead the development of our internal framework for creating BI reports, focusing on automating report generation through simple NLP tags within our clients' databases. In my role as Tech Lead, I spearhead a dynamic team of developers, orchestrating the end-to-end design and execution of projects. This involves meticulously crafting project blueprints from the ground up, ensuring each aspect aligns with our strategic objectives. Additionally, a key part of my responsibilities includes the precise estimation of time and resources, essential for the seamless delivery of our tasks and maintaining the highest standards of efficiency and quality.

In academia, Iâ€™m delving into Natural Language Processing and Data Visualization, specifically exploring the development of an automated data visualization recommendation system.

Fun fact: Outside of my tech career, I'm an enthusiastic blade smith and rock climber, embracing both the precision of craftsmanship and the thrill of adventure.
